# Hugo-website

This is a website that a designed using Hugo static website generator.
This is the first commit. But the project should build.
You need to have content folder at that root of the project. 
The content folder should contain projects and blog subfolders so the custom layout targetting those section would apply.
Use hugo to build the project.
Use hugo server to for a dev build..
